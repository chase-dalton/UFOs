# UFOs
Github Repo for the UFO's sighting's assignment
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to build an HTML page where a user is able to to parse through a JavaScript file by using filters embedded in the HTML page. Instead of trying to sift through an array of objects, the user can see easy-to-understand tabular data where they can filter the data how they please with convenient, dynamic filters.

## Results
The filtering capabilities of the HTML page makes navigating UFO sighting data a breeze. Initially the user is met with a webpage with a large amount of data like so:

![noFilter](https://github.com/typicalchazz/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/no_filter.png)

But by using the filters on the side, the data will be dynamically refreshed and filtered based on user input like so:
